# Kruskal's Algorithm (minimum spanning tree)

This code provides the implementation of Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST). A disjoint-set-union is implemented and used to check if the 
edge should be considered for the tree or not. It is noted that the graph needs to be connected, weighted and undirected. If the graph is not connected, the algorithm finds MST for each strongly connected components,
which is called minimum spanning forest.
